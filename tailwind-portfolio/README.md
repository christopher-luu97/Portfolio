This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`]
Combined with TailWindCSS for styling.

Why NextJS and TailWind CSS?

NextJS was chosen for my personal portfolio so that I could build a simple static yet fully interactive website to display my skills, experience and example projects.

TailWindCSS was chosen to allow me to quickly style HTML as I write it, allowing me to edit the elements as needed without needing to switch between files and maintain a history of the elements I wish to style.

Although there is the issue of seperating structure (HTML) and style (CSS), I have found TailWindCSS to quickly meet my needs for this portolio project.

- An example of me leveraging the separation of structure and style can be found witin my Transcription App. which separates .UI files (structure) from .qss files (style) which works in similar fashion to HTML and CSS.
